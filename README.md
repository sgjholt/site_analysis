**Site Analysis Toolbox**

This repository contains scripts currently under development to analyse site conditions.

The library is intended for my own personal research. 

Currently I am investigating the potential to calibrate site specific seismic velocity profiles using the 
Surface-to-Borehole ratio as a target. 

I will continue to update this page as development continues, currently the codes are in a very early state and
the validity of this method is being tested.
